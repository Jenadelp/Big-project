<h3>Online Shopping Carts Compared</h3>

<p>Shopping carts are used by businesses to provide customers with an easy and safe way to pay for products or services rendered.  There are three different routes that companies take: in-house, hosted, and open source software.  We will compare the three routes and the pros and cons of each.</p>

<p>“You'll need ecommerce web hosting to be able to cater for your shopping website, and ensure you add a credit card processing option to take payments online(Drake, DeMuro, Turner).”  This method isn’t as difficult as it seems and in the long run it’s much less expensive, however, there are safety risks if the payment information isn’t properly protected from potential hackers and other risks such as data leaks.  The reason why most companies and people prefer “off the shelf” shopping cart software is that it is already set-up, easy to use, and usually has proven to be effective at protecting people from security breaches.  This choice is certainly more expensive in the long run which is one perceived disadvantage.  One example of a seamless shopping cart software that is very popular in the U.S. is Shopify.  “The platform has widely been praised for being code free and indeed requires no knowledge of website coding whatsoever to setup and use…Shopify accepts all major credit cards and provides a fast checkout procedure via its very own Shopify Pay or by Apple Pay (Drake, DeMuro, Turner)."
    
<p>Another option that is popular is open network shopping cart software.  “Open-source shopping cart software lands in-between these two options. It requires some technical know-how to set up the integration, providing customization without the need to build everything in-house (Dune).”  This is also customizable, meaning any developer can access the source code and change or edit according to their needs.  Open source software is usually free, which is a great perk, but companies and individuals are responsible for knowing how to use the software are also responsible for working out in problems that might arise such as security risks.</p>

<p>The third option is building an in-house solution.  This can only be done if a company has a team of knowledgeable programmers that can create and maintain this software.  This also means they have to be responsible for data breaches and keeping client’s information safe from hackers.  This gives the company complete control over every facet and detail of the software which can be greatly to their advantage especially compared to a hosted software which is paid for monthly and usually includes a percentage of all purchases as well.  This option is certainly the most difficult to maintain and develop, however, in the long run it can reap many benefits such increased earnings and control over security threats.  Most companies are not able to develop this software unless they have the programmers on-staff that can focus strictly on maintaining and developing this software, so most companies find it easier to purchase a hosted software or use an open source option.</p>
