<h3> Responsive Versus Native Apps and Mobile Websites</h3>
 
<p>“When it comes to deciding whether to build a native app or a mobile website, the most appropriate choice really depends on your end goals. If you are developing an interactive game an app is probably going to be your best option. But if your goal is to offer mobile-friendly content to the widest possible audience then a mobile website is probably the way to go. In some cases you may decide you need both a mobile website and a mobile app, but it’s pretty safe to say that it rarely makes sense to build an app without already having a mobile website in place (Summerfield).”</p>


<H3>Responsive Web Design</H3>

<p>A responsive web site will adapt to the size of the screen on whatever device is being viewed. This includes cell phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops and will rival the usability of a mobile app, allowing the site to adapt aesthetically to the size of the device while maintaining its functionality and usability. 
 
With a responsive design, you are maintaining a single website. There’s no need to create specific content for mobile devices and no extra work is needed to market a separate app.
 
However, one of the drawbacks to using one website for all devices is there are outdated devices with old browsers that will load the website too slowly or not fully.

<h3>Mobile Website</h3>

<p>Mobile websites are designed for mobile devices considering both the drawbacks and advantages. Developers keep in mind the small screen size, touch screen, and cellular connection speed. The mobile website is responsive to varying screen sizes, has better chances to rank in search, loads fast and easily, and is immediately accessible over downloading apps.
 
One disadvantage of using mobile websites is that you have to maintain multiple URLS, which is more costly and time-consuming. In addition, they aren’t universally compatible with all mobile devices.

<h3>Native Applications</h3>

<p>“Responsive web requires users to go a long way to find you. They have to think of your brand, open the mobile navigator, type your website’s domain or, even worse, Google it, and then wait for the browser to load before accessing your content. Worst of all, users must repeat the entire process each time they want to connect with your business.
 
In contrast, if you have a native app, they will only have to think of you once. Then, after the app has been downloaded, you will be on their screens and minds every time they use their smartphone (Marillo).” 
 
A native application is software specifically designed for mobile devices. Native applications have better UX or user experience than any other mobile optimization option and operate without internet and provide visibility with an installed application.
 
Some of the drawbacks to using native applications: They aren’t accessible on all devices. Application updates have to be approved by the app store which can take a few weeks. They are the most expensive option. Native applications require a completely different marketing strategy than a responsive or mobile site.
